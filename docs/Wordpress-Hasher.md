# Wordpress Hasher

The wordpress password hasher is an adapter for the `\PasswordHash` class which is part of Wordpress. You can [find it here](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/class-phpass.php).

Copy the file to your project, rename the namespace or do whatever is needed to make it availabl in your project and / or namespace.

Then simply pass an instance of it to the WordpressPasswordHasher(). 

```php
use \PasswordHash
use \PasswordHasher\WordpressPasswordHasher;

$hasher = new WordpressPasswordHasher(new (PasswordHash(8, true)));
```
